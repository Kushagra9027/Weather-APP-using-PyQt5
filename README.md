Weather App
A Python-based weather app built using PyQt5, which fetches weather data from a public weather API and displays the current weather conditions for any city worldwide. The app provides information like:

Current Temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit)
1.Max Temperature
2.Min Temperature
3.Feels Like Temperature
4.Weather Description (Clear, Rain, etc.)
5.Weather Icon representing the condition (cloudy, sunny, etc.)


Features~
1.User-Friendly GUI: Built with PyQt5 for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
2.Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches live weather data from a weather API.
3.Dual Temperature Display: Shows both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
4.Weather Icons: Displays corresponding weather icons based on the current weather condition.
5.Easy City Search: Enter a city name, and the app fetches and displays relevant data.


Technologies Used~
1.Python: Programming language.
2.PyQt5: GUI library for building the app interface.
3.Requests: Used to fetch data from the weather API.
4.Weather API: External API used to fetch real-time weather data. (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
Requirements
Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

1.Python 3.x
2.PyQt5
3.requests library
To install the necessary dependencies, run:

bash
Copy
pip install pyqt5 requests
Installing Dependencies Automatically
If you'd prefer not to manually install dependencies, a requirements.txt file is provided in this repository. To install all the dependencies at once, use:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Set Up the API Key
This app uses an external API to fetch weather data. In order to use it, you need to obtain an API key.

Steps to Get API Key:
1.Sign up at a weather API provider, for example OpenWeatherMap.
2.After signing up, generate your free API key.
3.Replace the placeholder in the Python code where the API key is defined (usually in the part of the code that handles API requests).
4.Example for OpenWeatherMap API:
#python
Copy
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
Make sure to insert the API key into the code before running the app.

Code Structure
Here’s a brief breakdown of the project structure:

bash
Copy
weather-app/
│
├── weather_app.py        # Main Python file where the app runs
├── requirements.txt      # List of Python dependencies (PyQt5, requests, etc.)
├── README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
├── icons/                # Folder containing weather condition icons
├── assets/               # Optional folder for additional images or resources
└── LICENSE               # Project license information
weather_app.py: This is the main file that contains the logic to create the PyQt5 interface, handle user input, and fetch weather data.
icons/: This folder contains icons for various weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy) that are displayed in the app.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy
cd weather-app
Install the dependencies (if not done already):
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app by executing the Python script:
bash
Copy
python weather_app.py
Enter the name of a city in the input field. The app will automatically fetch the weather data for that city and display:
Current temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit)
Max/Min temperatures
Feels like temperature
Weather description (Sunny, Cloudy, Rain, etc.)
Corresponding weather icon

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, try the following steps:

Ensure that you have an active internet connection to fetch data from the weather API.
Double-check that your API key is correctly added to the code.
Make sure that all dependencies are installed, and the correct version of Python is being used.
Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you’d like to improve the app or add new features, please feel free to fork this repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Add multiple language support for the UI.
Implement location-based weather fetching using GPS.
Improve the weather data presentation, for example by showing hourly forecasts.
Add a dark mode for better UX during night usage.
